Load balance- Added to distribute traffic evenly and ensure high availability and scalability.

Database Server: Added to manage website data and ensure data integrity and persistence.

This setup is Active-Passive. In an Active-Passive setup, one server (the active server) handles all incoming traffic, while the other server (the passive server) remains on standby. In the event of a failure, the passive server takes over to maintain service availability.

Load Balancer Configuration:

HAProxy is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm, which routes each new request to the next server in line, distributing the load evenly.

Database Primary-Replica Cluster:

In a Primary-Replica cluster, the Primary node (Master) handles all write operations (inserts, updates, deletes), while the Replica nodes (Slaves) replicate data from the Primary and handle read operations.

The Primary node is responsible for handling write operations and maintaining data consistency, while the Replica nodes replicate data from the Primary and serve read-only queries. If the Primary node fails, one of the Replica nodes can be promoted to the Primary role to maintain continuity of service.
