Separation of Components onto Different Servers:

By splitting components onto separate servers, we enhance scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of maintenance.
Isolating the application server and database onto dedicated servers allows for better resource management and optimization.
Load-Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster:

HAproxy is configured as a cluster with multiple instances to ensure high availability and redundancy.
Clustering HAproxy instances provides fault tolerance, where if one instance fails, others can seamlessly handle incoming traffic.


Separating the web server, application server, and database onto dedicated servers improves scalability and resource utilization.
It allows each component to scale independently based on its specific resource requirements.
